# I think there are a lot of loopholes in the practices that are used right now.

For example, even for the question from lecture, when companies focus solely on increasing utility for shareholders, they may justify this as optimizing utility for all stakeholders because it achieves higher total utility compared to other actions. However, this approach often disproportionately benefits shareholders, compromising the well-being of other stakeholders. A possible solution might be to redefine or limit the role of shareholders within the broader stakeholder framework. Otherwise, companies can easily justify harmful compromises by claiming that shareholder optimization serves the greater good.

B-Corps seem like a promising alternative to address these issues. They not only set clear metrics for accountability but also strive to improve them over time: “We update and improve our standards on a regular basis. While specific revision mechanisms will vary by the nature of the project, all standards development projects are informed by research and multi-stakeholder input”. I think it is important that they always try to improve their standards because it could prevent situations like the one with TOMS Shoes, where well-intentioned efforts inadvertently caused harm due to a lack of comprehensive planning and waiting for others to point out problems in the current system.

In a profit-driven culture, companies often exploit loopholes in societal or regulatory standards. This is seen in workplace policies that prioritize optics over genuine employee well-being. For instance, during interviews, many companies offer perks like meals served late in the evening. But such benefits often mask unhealthy work cultures where employees stay excessively late. Society's tendency to praise finding loopholes as "genius" only perpetuates these problems. To encourage authentic and ethical practices, companies must face consequences for exploiting loopholes. Otherwise, companies will keep finding loopholes even in B-Corps standards and make the useless.

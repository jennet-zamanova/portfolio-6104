# Reconsidering User Testing: Users That Are Friends as Participants

One thing I’ve been thinking about after the lecture is how we can make user testing more efficient. We talked a lot about the importance of getting testers to talk and give feedback, but this can be difficult, especially when working with introverted or shy participants. We can't just rely on interviewing talkative people because that would exclude a significant demographic. Plus, what if your target audience includes those who are more reserved? This got me wondering: could we get better results by testing with users who are friends?

From my experience testing multiplayer games, when you’re testing with friends, it’s usually easier to relax and make mistakes—and I think that’s a good thing. In a formal setting, people might hesitate to admit confusion or might not be as straightforward about what isn’t working. But with friends, the dynamic feels different—people are more open, they talk through their thought process, and they’re less worried about appearing “dumb.” That kind of comfort can help reveal usability issues that might be missed in a more formal setting.

Another strategy we touched on in class was randomizing the order of tasks for each participant, but I also think having them perform the tasks more than once could be helpful. This could show us whether certain problems are related to task order or if the design itself is causing confusion. Repeating tasks might also highlight whether the design is intuitive enough to stick after just one attempt. For example, with the gear app shown in lecture, you could have one friend list their gear while the other tries to find it, and then switch roles.

The biggest challenge, though, is getting people to test in the first place. Finding one person can be hard enough, let alone their friends. One potential solution is to make it a social experience—something like, “Grab a coffee with a friend while testing out this app.” Framing it like this could make people more likely to participate, since it’s not just about testing; it’s also about spending time with someone. This approach is used successfully in the gaming industry, so it could work for other types of software too.

# Beta Release

## Design Revisions
- Initially, we planned to have one general inventory for fibers. However, we introduced separate inventories for general use, project-specific, and guide-specific contexts to address complications around reducing fiber amounts and resource managing.
- To introduce a unique and impactful aspect to our app, we added eco-friendly and beginner-friendly ratings to guides, allowing users to filter guides by their sustainability or ease of use.
- We’ve made it so that importing a guide now automatically adds the guide’s link in the “Links” section of the project. Additionally, to distinguish it from other links, the frontend would specify the guide link if it was imported from a guide, making it easy to navigate between guides and projects without forming an extrinsic or intrinsic dependency.
- We had a deep conversation about how importing guides would properly adjust/show the fiber types and amounts. Firstly, the action of importing a guide and creating a project both "creates a project", so they were put under the same route. Secondly, we initially made syncs for adding new fiber to a project as well as adding fiber to a project from the inventory, which we ultimately incorporated into createProjects for when a user imports guides. There were also discussions about how the guides and different inventories interact with each other.

## Select Participants
- college student from Yale University who has little to no knowledge of sewing but is interested in learning and crafting something small
- college student (different college) who has been doing sewing, embroidery, and a lot of crafts since middle school
- expert hands-on creator who enjoys crafting costumes and stuffed animals

## Prepopulate Data
Test accounts have been richly populated to reflect a user who has been using the app for a good amount of time:
- guides are populated not only with the pre-existing ones but also comprehensive guides created by several other users, varying in eco-friendly and beginner-friendly ratings
- several projects have been created in the test account, both manually created and imported from guides
- projects have been populated with notes, links, images, and materials that someone actually working through a project may include
- inventory has been filled with realistic fiber types and yardages
- comments were added below some guides

## Task List
| Title | Instruction | Rationale
| -------- | ------- | -------
| Create an Account and Log In | Create an account with the username and password provided, then log in to start using the app. | Assesses if users can intuitively begin their Craftfolio experience. Testing authentication and sessioning ensures the user can successfully start using the platform and serves as a good warm up to start off the session
| Add Materials to Inventory | Add three materials to your inventory: one with full details provided, one with partial details, and one while only looking at a picture of the material to add. | It tests how users interact with the inventory system, including flexibility in data entry and identifying areas where more guidance or error handling is needed (we want beginners to be able to do it easily).
| Find and Use Guides | Find the most beginner-friendly guide and the most eco-friendly guide. Import one guide into a project (that can be used given the user’s inventory). | Evaluates whether users can effectively use the rating system and inventory checks to find and select guides and whether the import process is intuitive, especially when dealing with inventory constraints (does the design iteration we made makes sense to the user - like distinguishing materials in and out of inventory).
| Manage a Project | Locate the project you just imported, add a note, upload an image, and find the link to the original guide. | Tests if users can navigate project details, integrate external resources, and effectively use project-specific features like notes and links (i.e. does tab system actually simplify the navigating of the details or make it more complex).
| Delete a Project | Mark the imported project as abandoned and delete it. | Explores whether users can intuitively manage project statuses and understand the implications of deleting projects.
| Create a Guide | Create a new guide with the provided text, tips, and mistakes, and materials. | Tests whether users can follow the workflow for guide creation, including associating materials, tips, and errors, revealing usability issues in the guide-posting process. (The information would be provided because those posting the guide would be more experienced.)
| Comment on a Guide | Add a comment to an existing guide, then attempt to delete it. | Ensures the commenting system is straightforward and usable, testing both adding and managing comments.
| Check Inventory Suggestions | Import a guide that requires a fiber not in your inventory, and examine the suggested alternatives. | Evaluates whether users understand how alternative materials are suggested and whether this feature helps them make informed decisions.
| Explore Eco-Friendly Metrics | Assess how eco-friendly your inventory is based on ratings. | Examines the prominence and utility of eco-friendly ratings, helping determine if they need better integration into the user interface to encourage sustainable crafting choices.

## Design Revisions
- Initially, we planned to have one general inventory for fibers. However, we introduced separate inventories for general use, project-specific, and guide-specific contexts to address complications around reducing fiber amounts and resource managing.
- To introduce a unique and impactful aspect to our app, we added eco-friendly and beginner-friendly ratings to guides, allowing users to filter guides by their sustainability or ease of use.
- We‚Äôve made it so that importing a guide now automatically adds the guide‚Äôs link in the ‚ÄúLinks‚Äù section of the project. Additionally, to distinguish it from other links, the frontend would specify the guide link if it was imported from a guide, making it easy to navigate between guides and projects without forming an extrinsic or intrinsic dependency.
- We had a deep conversation about how importing guides would properly adjust/show the fiber types and amounts. Firstly, the action of importing a guide and creating a project both "creates a project", so they were put under the same route. Secondly, we initially made syncs for adding new fiber to a project as well as adding fiber to a project from the inventory, which we ultimately incorporated into createProjects for when a user imports guides. There were also discussions about how the guides and different inventories interact with each other.
- We‚Äôve made the eco and beginner friendly ratings more prominent by displaying them with stars. We‚Äôve also displayed them on the home page on each individual guide as well so that users can see them without needing to click into them.
- We modified commenting to allow users to specify the type of comments they have. Users are able to write a general comment, ask a question, and give a tip (distinctions shown through an icon).

## Study Reports 

### Participant 1
The participant demonstrated both enthusiasm and moments of confusion during their interaction with the platform, providing key insights into the platform's usability. They excelled at finding guides and navigating some of the provided features but struggled in areas that required precise interactions or clearer labeling. For example, when adding materials to the inventory, they defaulted to generic names like "fabric 1," explaining that they were unsure what to name their fabric. When prompted later, they suggested that names should be optional but noted their utility for organizing similar materials intended for different uses. This reflects a conceptual gap in understanding mandatory versus optional fields.

A standout moment was their excitement upon discovering the recommended vs alternative fibers + showing the presence of the fibers feature, exclaiming, "Why did I not think of creating a spreadsheet to have all my materials?! This is so helpful to see what I need to do for the guides!" They appreciated the visual clarity of distinguishing between available and unavailable materials, emphasizing the value of this feature in helping them stay organized. This highlights the platform‚Äôs potential to provide not just functionality but inspiration for crafting workflows. However, the participant initially overlooked key elements such as the "makeable" guides filter and expressed confusion about the purpose of certain checkboxes. This indicates that while the interface supported exploration, key functionalities might benefit from being more prominent. During the guide import process, they suggested organizing materials into "need to buy" and "have already" sections, noting that this would simplify planning and tracking, helping incorporate the inventory even more into their project.

Another significant observation was their uncertainty about whether changes were autosaved. While no save button was present, they hesitated before moving forward, reflecting a lack of feedback for completed actions (since a lot of other platforms tend to save everything together). For commenting, the participant found it counterintuitive that newly added comments were hidden by default and suggested that they should automatically appear after submission. Despite these challenges, their adaptability and ability to discover features indicate that usability improvements could enhance both efficiency and satisfaction.


### Participant 2
This participant's interaction with Craftfolio revealed several interesting insights into user behavior and expectations. For example, while adding materials to the inventory, the user demonstrated a preference for visual cues over textual descriptions, commenting ‚Äúpicking colors is actually fun‚Äù. This suggests that visual aids are effective, but flexibility in data entry is needed to accommodate users who may struggle with descriptive tasks. Interestingly, the participant thought all fields were mandatory, despite not being marked as such, indicating a need for clearer affordances in optional versus required inputs.

Exploring guides brought more conceptual challenges. The participant noted confusion about the difference between guides and projects, stating, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure why they are separate.‚Äù She also appreciated the beginner and eco ratings but assumed they were user-generated, suggesting, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be fun to have creators rated too, like ‚Äòthis creator always explains well for beginner..‚Äô‚Äù This feedback reflects both the feature‚Äôs appeal and an opportunity to leverage community input for engagement. Furthermore, the participant misunderstood the filter's purpose, assuming it ‚Äújust sorts instead of letting you set a minimum score.‚Äù This was attributed to her personal preference for exploration over structured filtering, underscoring the need to balance features for diverse user preferences.

Additionally, some interface challenges emerged, particularly when Safari rendered certain elements differently, like checkboxes during guide importing. Although switching to Chrome resolved the issue, this inconsistency undermined the overall experience. The user also stated that they would have preferred a user confirmation when removing materials from inventory after importing guides. Finally, in managing projects, the participant misunderstood the scope of the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button, thinking it only allowed project name changes. She successfully modified the project after guidance but remarked, ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt ask me!‚Äù when deleting the project, reinforcing the need for a confirmation step to align with common user expectations, as was also the case in the first user test.

In the guide creation process, the participant expected it to conclude after the first page, expressing surprise when asked to add more details. She remarked, ‚ÄúI thought I was done after the first page‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt clear there‚Äôd be more.‚Äù This observation highlights a gap in communicating the multi-step workflow, which could be addressed with a progress bar or introductory message outlining the steps. This would help set user expectations and prevent confusion. While the linear nature of the workflow is not inherently problematic, improving transparency about what to expect would enhance the experience.

These observations, grounded in direct participant feedback and inferred behaviors, reveal a mix of positive experiences (e.g., intuitive inventory management and beginner-friendly features) and actionable opportunities to improve Craftfolio‚Äôs usability.


### Participant 3
Starting off with the inventory, the participant was stuck when filling out the form to add a fiber, specifically the "Name" attribute. He felt that the brand and type was enough to classify a fiber, and the yardage attribute of the fibers should not accept negative values. On the Projects page, he was able to create a project with notes, links, images, and materials, although he expressed confusion on why the Images tab had an input textbox (which is because the images need to be inputted as links). On the Home page, he was successful in filtering guides by eco friendly and beginner friendly rating. However, he expected to be able to filter by both ratings simultaneously (e.g. eco friendly: 5, beginner friendly: 2) and see what filters are applied, making a reference to "online shopping where the user can see exactly which filters are checked". This would definitely help with the user's readability as they wouldn't have to look through the input form to remember which filter they applied. Besides these filters, the filter for showing makeable guides went unnoticed until brought up, likely due to its lack of prominence. 

Moving on to the actual content of the guide, the participant found it very hard to digest all of the information of the guides due to its text-heavy nature and little bolding/emphasis besides the subtitles (e.g. tips, mistakes, links, fibers). An interesting claim by the participant was "the page is too long. Everything seems to be stacked on top of another. There should be more of a column structure and perhaps make the markdown collapsible." Additionally, he felt the organization of the page wasn't the most appealing. Tips, mistakes, and links should be grouped together since they have similar designs and serve as a helpful resource. After clicking on import guide, the participant was confused on what the purpose of it was. I believe this was because he wasn't aware of the main feature of importing a guide, which is the ability to bring the fibers of a guide into the project inventory by checking them before importing. He did not realize that they were checkboxes and thought they were just there to show whether the fiber exists in the general inventory. He also did not realize the established connection between a guide and project through the Links tab. For people just starting to use this app, I'd definitely agree this is something hard to just know. There's nothing on the interface that makes this action clear, so instructions on checkmarking fibers and importing guide would enhance clarity for the user.

In the comments section, the participant really liked the ability to clarify whether they're asking a question, giving a tip, or simply commenting. "Often times when I ask a question in a forum, it just gets lost in the pool of comments answering previous questions. The ? here places a greater emphasis on my question to be seen." One issue was that he couldn't see his comment immediately after posting since it was hidden, and the show/hide comment button doesn't really stick out, so adding some color to emphasize it would make it more intuitive. While creating his own guide, the participant didn't run into any issues. One interesting thing the participant did after writing a guide was clicking on the stars to adjust his ratings. He didn't expect the ratings to be auto generated. He also noticed that the generated beginner friendly ratings weren't reasonable because the 1 to 1 ratio of tips, mistakes, and links to stars isn't reflective of the guide. Overall, the participant found not only the user experience to be very appealing due to ease of flow but he also found majority of the user interface to be aesthetically pleasing due to the warm neutral colors that evokes a sense of calm and eco friendliness.

## Design Flaws/Opportunities
- **Flaw: Image Input Is Not Error-Tolerant**
    - **Explanation:** The participant faced confusion when attempting to upload an image using a link. The lack of error handling and guidance led to missteps.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Implement robust error messages for invalid image inputs and offer a guided walkthrough for acceptable formats.
    - **Level:** Physical
    - **Severity:** Moderate
- **Flaw: Unclear Field Requirements in Inventory**
    - **Explanation:** The participant did not know which fields (e.g., material name) were mandatory. This ambiguity led to confusion and less descriptive entries.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Use visual cues (e.g., asterisks or tooltips) to mark required fields and offer placeholder suggestions for optional ones.
    - **Level:** Linguistic
    - **Severity:** Minor
- **Opportunity: Clarify Save Mechanism**
    - **Explanation:** The participant wondered if a save button existed during tasks like adding tips, materials, or mistakes, suggesting uncertainty about whether actions were being autosaved or required confirmation.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Display clear autosave notifications or include an optional "Save" button for reassurance. Consistent feedback when changes are captured can eliminate uncertainty.
    - **Level:** Conceptual
    - **Severity:** Moderate
- **Opportunity: Enhanced Guide Import Experience**
    - **Explanation:** While importing guides, the participant suggested grouping materials into "need to buy" and "have already" categories for better organization and printing convenience.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Add sortable, printable inventory sections in the guide import interface, facilitating seamless planning and shopping.
    - **Level:** Conceptual
    - **Severity:** Moderate
- **Flaw: Hidden Comments Create Confusion**
    - **Explanation:** The participant could not see their newly added comment immediately due to the default "hide" state of comments.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Change the default behavior to show newly added comments or prompt users to expand comments upon addition.
    - **Level:** Linguistic
    - **Severity:** Minor
- **Flaw: Confusion Between Guides and Projects**
    - **Explanation:** The current design does not clearly delineate the conceptual distinction between guides and projects.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Add a short tooltip or a visual distinction, such as icons or labels, to clarify the difference. Consider a welcome tutorial to introduce key terms.
    - **Level:** Conceptual
    - **Severity:** Moderate
- **Flaw: Missing Confirmation for Inventory Changes**
    - **Explanation:** Users are accustomed to confirmation dialogs for significant changes, and the lack of one creates uncertainty.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Implement a modal asking, "Are you sure?" when removing materials from inventory due to guide imports. Allow users to toggle this feature in settings.
    - **Level:** Physical
    - **Severity:** Major
- **Flaw: Lack of Clarity in Guide Creation Steps**
    - **Explanation:** The participant expected the process to end after the first page of inputs and was surprised by additional steps. This indicates that the workflow does not sufficiently communicate its multi-step nature upfront.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Add a progress bar or step indicator to show users how many steps are involved in the guide creation process. This reassures users that they will have an opportunity to add more details in subsequent parts and helps set expectations. Additionally, a brief introductory message at the start could outline what the process entails (e.g., "Step 1: Basic Info, Step 2: Add Materials, Step 3: Finalize Guide").
    - **Level:** Linguistic/Conceptual
    - **Severity:** Moderate
- **Opportunity: Expand Beginner/Eco Ratings to Include Community Feedback**
    - **Explanation:** The user saw potential for greater community engagement through ratings provided by other users or creators.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Allow users to rate guides after completing them and give creators an option to provide additional insights, fostering a community-driven system.
    - **Level:** Conceptual
    - **Severity:** Moderate
- **Flaw: Hidden Comments Post Submission**
    - **Explanation:** Comments default to a "hidden" state, which is not intuitive for users expecting immediate visibility.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Make new comments visible by default and provide a toggle for hiding or showing them.
    - **Level:** Physical
    - **Severity:** Minor
- **Flaw: Unclear Connection Between Import Guide and Projects**
    - **Explanation:** The participant was not aware that they could check the fibers from a guide, which would then automatically appear in the project materials.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Include clear instructions or labels on the connection between the fibers in a guide and importing the guide.
    - **Level:** Linguistic/Conceptual
    - **Severity:** Major
- **Flaw: Text-Heavy Guide Content**
    - **Explanation:** The participant was overwhelmed by the vast amounts of content in certain guides and how long the page scrolled for.
    - **Proposed Solution:** There can be more of a column structure rather than every section being in their own row, and the markdown section should be scrollable instead of being as long as the content length.
    - **Level:** Physical
    - **Severity:** Moderate

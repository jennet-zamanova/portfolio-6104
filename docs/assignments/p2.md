# Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals
**Craftfolio** is a web app designed for beginner crafters looking to confidently start and complete creative fiber projects. Our app targets a unique, underserved audience of new crafters who often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of project planning and lack of accessible resources. Craftfolio empowers users by providing an intuitive project tracker and resource management tools tailored specifically to beginners working with different fibers. Unlike existing crafting communities that focus mainly on showcasing finished projects, **Craftfolio** offers a collaborative space for planning, sharing, and discussing project materials.

Key features include personalized project filters based on available sources, community tagging to quickly connect with experienced crafters, and badges to celebrate project milestones, fostering a supportive and interactive environment. Craftfolio's value lies in bridging the gap between inspiration and execution, helping users efficiently manage crafting resources and build confidence through shared expertise.

## Scrapbook of Comparables
![](p2_media_files\vsco.png)

This screenshot is from VSCO, a photo editing app, showing an image posted by a user. There is no concept of liking the image; users may only favorite the image, which then saves it into their favorites collection displayed on another page. Could this feature be applied to focus on creativity and sharing images that inspire, avoiding the pressure of popularity metrics? Could the favoriting be applied to save inspiring or interesting techniques, patterns, fabric types, etc.? Crafters are able to get quick access to these items by favoriting them.

![](p2_media_files\knightlab.png)

This screenshot is from a website called Knight Lab Timeline, showing a visual timeline with media elements like images, videos, and links. Could this feature be applied on a smaller scale (more of a day-to-day than year-to-year basis) to enable crafters to manage their projects? Crafters could mark the progress they’ve made on a certain project with images to show the physical item as well as text descriptions of inventory, remarks, and more. Crafters may also add images and videos from tutorials and samples that they found could be useful to their project.

![](p2_media_files\youtubekids.png)

YouTube Kids is YouTube but a more controlled layout with more controlled content for them. This could help address our VSD analysis on the impact on children stakeholders, as providing a different layout might help facilitate learning for kids along with different types of media.

![](p2_media_files\clickmaint.png)

This is a picture of Click Maint, an inventory management system. It’s showing all of the inventory and parts available, along with costs, desired material count, available count, and more. This could be a good example to stem off of for a UI.

![](p2_media_files\pcpartpicker.png)

PCPartPicker is a website where users can search for different PC parts and customize their own PC build and check how much it would cost. In addition, for each part there is a link to a shopping website to buy the part and you are also able to buy the entire build into a single shopping cart. Thus, we can use this feature for users to pick up different materials for a project, see how much it would cost and then decide if they want to buy the materials or not.

![](p2_media_files\duolingo.png)

This is DuoLingo, an app dedicated for users to learn new languages. In the app, there is a feature of different roadmaps, where each circle is a lesson you can take on the corresponding topic. Can we use this feature to have users learn the basics of sewing/knitting? Furthermore, we could use this type of roadmap for different tutorials, where the user can progress to their project step by step with defined goals.

![](p2_media_files\starseller.png)

This is the star seller badge in Etsy - craft-selling platform. Could we use a similar badging system to motivate users to help each other out?

![](p2_media_files\etsy.png)

This is also from Etsy. Links to the shop they got the item from (even when you click on the image it goes to the shop) are displayed. Could we use this to make it easier for the beginners to find materials they need?

![](p2_media_files\slack.jpg)

This is from Slack - team-communication platform. Could we use “reply in thread”-like options for beginners that need more conversation with some other crafter to figure out their issue (wo overcrowding the comment section) and get notifications as soon as someone responds to help out?

![](p2_media_files\trello.png)

This is Trello - project management tool. I wonder whether we could use this board style and the drag-and-drop interaction for the ideation of project: have images for the ideas and patterns that can be moved around.

## Brainstorming Features
1. **Color Visualizer:** The most commonly knitted/sewn items tend to be wearable, such as scarves, socks, sweaters, blankets, etc. Typically, people want to see how a specific colored item would look. This feature will allow users to select a model of some wearable item and select a color to visualize what it may look like.

2. **Material Wishlist:** Users can save materials that they’d like to try or are required for future and current projects. When browsing guides or images, users may find inspiration in a certain material they would consider using in the future.

3. **Project Stopwatch:** Users may want to track insights on project duration, potentially to better understand their crafting pace or better plan for future projects. This feature is a simple timer that users can start and stop to track the time invested in crafting.

4. **Skill Logbook:** This is a logbook to record specific skills users have learned or practiced through different projects. Users can quickly refer back to these skills if used again in the future, along with tips or links to helpful resources.

5. **Craft Roulette:** Some crafters may run out of ideas or have no inspiration on what to make. With this feature, users can spin a virtual wheel that randomly suggests a mini project, material, or color palette to try, pushing for fun and spontaneous crafting ideas.

6. **Clothesline / Thread Trails:** Users can view photos from the past, potentially of their finished projects or of people wearing a gifted item that was crafted. The photos will be placed on a clothesline, inspired by “Story of My Life” by One Direction.

7. **Craft Fortune Cookies:** Users can open a fortune cookie that provides a small crafting tip, inspirational quote, or a creative prompt to encourage creative thinking.

8. **Project Doodles:** Users can use this sketchpad to doodle ideas or make quick sketches for their projects, which they can then add to a project’s notes.

9. **AR Real Life Visualizer:** Users can use their phone cameras and see the potential outcome in real life, giving them a better sense of the real-life size of their projects.

10. **Achievements:** Some dashboard that tracks personal achievements, perhaps being the number of projects finished, or number of times you’ve helped out.

11. **Deadline Setter:** Allows Users to set their own deadlines on when they want some parts of the project to be finished by, giving them more incentive to keep working.

12. **Mood-based palette generator:** An inspiration tool where users can select or even type a mood and the app suggests colors that match their mood.

13. **Event-based craft challenges:** themed craft challenges to encourage users to create projects based on a theme (halloween, christmas themed, etc.). 

14. **Project Difficulty Prediction:** The app predicts the difficulty of a project based on user input, project guidelines, patterns used, etc. Could also be just the creator giving a guess on the difficulty.

15. **Photo color matcher:** Users can give a photo, and the app will choose the strongest colors in the photo and generate a color palette, along with corresponding materials. Allows users to further their creative process by taking a similar “vibe” to the picture they input.

16. **Local Meetups and In-Person Events Feature:** A location-based feature that allows users to find local crafting meetups or workshops. People could post their own events for advertisement to foster an in-person community.

17. **Timed Stretch breaks alerts:** Before starting a new project and from time to time, the app would notify the user to take a break and stretch their wrists to prevent pain and discomfort after a long session of sewing/knitting.

18. **Project Scheduler:** Users can schedule to work on projects on certain times in advance. Thus, they are able to plan ahead with materials and tutorials.

19. **Timestamps:** During a project, a user is able to navigate to different steps of a tutorial in easily accessible timestamps. Furthermore, the user can create their own timestamp to pick up where they stopped at a project.

20. **Pattern Designer:** Users are able to create or edit patterns, adding new colors or styles to a new or existing project.

21. **Project Bookmarks/Wishlist:** In the app, there are several tutorials/projects where the user is really interested in making and thus can save them for later. 

22. **Pattern/Project Recommendations:** After finishing a project, checking a tutorial, or sewing a pattern, the app would give users recommendations on what to work next given the users personal interests and the project they just finished.

23. **Troubleshooter/Helper:** While working on a project, if the user encounters a problem while sewing/knitting, then the user can ask the app for tips on how to resolve the specific problem they are having.

24. **Project/Material Bundles:** In the app, the user is able to access a list that contains all the links to access materials needed for a project. Then, the user is able to add all materials into a shopping basket where they can buy them in a few clicks.

25. **Fabric Collection:** Users can add the fabrics that they own already. For each potential project, display which materials they own and which ones they do not. Dynamically update available amount of material based on which material is used on ongoing projects.

26. **Boards:** Create a board for different ideas for a project. Add patterns, links to tutorials, fabric photos, etc. to create a “idea-board” for a new project to help with the ideation phase for the new crafters

27. **Sustainability Tracker:** Tracks and provides insights on the environmental impact of users' crafting materials. Suggests eco-friendly alternatives and upcycling ideas to minimize waste.

28. **Material Substitution Assistant:** Users can input a pattern’s required materials, and the tool suggests compatible substitutions from their inventory or local stores. Incorporates cost comparisons, ensuring users stay within their budget. 

29. **Online Calculator:** Calculate the amounts of fiber needed based on the dimensions the user is going for and the fiber type available.

30. **Voice-Activated Knitting/Crocheting Assistant:** Say the pattern schema when the user asks for a specific row. Can be hard to memorize a pattern line \`Row 3: Dc in next 3 sts; \***ch 1, skip next st, dc in next st,**\*\* work a shell in next st; rep from * across row, ending last rep at **.\` so having an assistant read out loud without having to take your hands off the hooks can make it easier to get started and faster to proceed through the pattern for a beginner.

## Concept Outline
**Inventorying**

*Purpose:* Users can add materials to their inventory and check how much materials they have.

*Operational Principle:* After obtaining a new material, the user adds a material to their inventory. Then, if they need a material, they are able to check how much material they have.

**Timelining**

*Purpose:* Users are able to organize different steps in the form of text, images or videos in chronological order in a timeline.

*Operational Principle:* After writing steps of a project, a user can organize the steps into a timeline.

**Bookmarking**

*Purpose:* Users are able to bookmark a position in a project and go back to that position at a later time.

*Operational Principle:* The user wants to take a break from a project. Thus, the user bookmarks the position he stopped to return at a later time.

**Guide Posting**

*Purpose:* Users are able to post guides of sewing/crochet/knitting projects.

*Operational Principle:* After posting a guide, other users are able to follow the guide to do the corresponding project.

**Noting**

*Purpose:* Users take notes on a project to keep track of necessary information like stitches.

*Operational Principle:* While working on a sewing project, an user takes a note of information arising from doing the project, and to later check it if the information is needed.

**Ideating**

*Purpose:* Users take different parts of a sewing project to create an idea for a project.

*Operational Principle:* After looking for patterns, yarn, stitches, etc., the user collects all these items and creates a new idea for a project.

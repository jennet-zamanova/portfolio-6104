# Impact Case

## Team Contract

All team members are expecting an A on the project and are willing to put in 10-15 hours weekly, adjusted based on the requirements of the specific assignment. Typically, assignments towards the end, like backend and frontend code, would require more time. The following are the personal goals for each team member. Jennet hopes to build a meaningful app. Kevin hopes to build a complete app and get better at Vue because he didn’t spend enough time on the frontend. Jacky hopes that the app is something that target users would actually use. Brian hopes to build a polished app and improve design and frontend skills. The team will be meeting twice a week at the Student Center, once on Thursday 5-6pm to broadly discuss the assignment and assign tasks and once on Monday 2:30-4pm to discuss progress and any potential areas of difficulty and confusion. Time and length of [meetings](https://w2m.shenshen.mit.edu/6104-team-meeting-208829) will be adjusted accordingly if a team member is unable to make the time that week. Quality of work will be maintained through PRs if there are merge conflicts, different branches for version control, and team testing/review to ensure functionality. Tasks will be assigned as evenly as possible based on approximate time and interest. If deadlines are missed, the whole team must be responsible to finish missing requirements by EOD Thursday. Individuals must also communicate ASAP if they aren’t able to meet the deadline for their assigned task, so the team can potentially help out to turn assignment in by EOD Wednesday. Decisions will be made primarily at team meetings, and disagreements will be resolved through meetings with our mentor and professors if necessary.

## Draft Impact Case

The problem of sewing accessibility and project management is important because many beginners and even experienced sewists struggle with finding the right patterns, understanding material requirements, and organizing their projects effectively, which can hinder creativity and progress.

Our solution to address this problem is a comprehensive sewing app that combines pattern discovery and customization, fabric guidance, and project management tools in one easy-to-use platform.

We believe this is a good solution because it streamlines the entire sewing process—users can find patterns suited to their skill level, get recommendations on materials based on the project requirements, and track their progress within a single app. This integration makes sewing more approachable, organized, and enjoyable, especially for those new to the craft.

We could measure user retention, project completion rates, and engagement metrics (e.g., pattern usage, fabric selection support, and project tracking) to prove that this app is a good solution to making sewing more accessible and organized. Additionally, user satisfaction surveys and reductions in project setup time would provide further insights into the app's impact on the sewing experience.

## List of Interview Roles and Potential Interviewees

We mostly wanted to interview stakeholders, specifically those who sewed, crocheted, or knitted, and have them talk about their crafts at differing levels of experience. These were to see what the major challenges that came up for them, and how to address them all even at differing levels. Our first potential interviewee was Grace Jau, a college student who often crocheted and sometimes sewed, who had been crocheting for several years. Another interviewee was Nurana, also a college student who liked knitting and crocheting, but could speak more about her crocheting from when she first started in middle and high school. We also had Brian’s sister, a college student who knitted as a hobby. Finally, our last potential stakeholder interviewee was Becca, a full time employee in her 20’s who started knitting her freshman year of college. Although a small range of ages, we believed that this would be a great way to appeal towards those who weren’t professionals, but had enough experience to understand what they might want from our system. However, we also wanted to contact at least one expert, and Jennet’s friend’s mom was a great choice, as she was an adult who sewed a lot as a hobby, and had been doing so for a very long time.

| A Beginner’s Guide to Sewing with Knitted Fabrics by Wendy Ward ([link](https://wendyward.wordpress.com/2018/01/01/a-beginners-guide-to-sewing-with-knitted-fabrics-an-introduction/))      | This book is a guide to different types of knitted fabrics, what they’re like to work with and wear, and how to choose the best fabric for your project. Wendy Ward worked as a designer in the fashion industry and a knitting teacher, which left her with a love of working with knitted fabrics.                                                                                                                                                      | **Support:** Wendy emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate fabric for a project, noting that the choice of fabric can significantly affect the outcome. She highlights that beginners often struggle with understanding fabric properties and matching them to suitable patterns. This illustrates that there is a need for resources that guide sewists through material choices, such as detailed advice on fabric selection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This article outlines common mistakes that beginners make when starting their sewing journey. It provides practical advice to help novice sewists avoid these pitfalls, improve their skills, and enjoy a more successful sewing experience.                                                                                                                                                             | **Support:** The article covers a variety of issues such as selecting improper fabric, neglecting to read pattern instructions, taking on projects that are too advanced, lacking sufficient project planning, and using incorrect tools. Clearly, there are many aspects beginners struggle with, but some may be easier to learn about and overcome than others, so it’s important to gauge what information is the least accessible to sewers from the stakeholder interviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Stitching the Future: Technology's Impact on the Sewing Industry ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8gtCvO6rSg))                                                                      | In this podcast video, Ashley and Bethany explore how modern advancements are enabling sewists to express themselves in ways they could only dream of, and how they're reshaping the industry as a whole. They poke at the awe-inspiring possibilities that technology offers to sewers of all skill levels, from beginners to seasoned experts.                                                                                                          | **Support:** When discussing how AI can elevate the sewing experience, Bethany claims she wants to open the door and say “Alexa, good morning to my sewing room, please set up my space to work today, tell me what’s on my to-do list, list what projects I’m working on today, where did I leave off yesterday, do I have any of material X in my stash.” She wants her “space to come to life by the command of her voice”. From this, it seems Bethany wants some software to help her easily maintain information on her work and available materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| The Value of Handcrafting in a Technology-Driven World by Marisa Valotta ([link](https://medium.com/quinnipiac-icm506/the-value-of-handcrafting-in-a-technology-driven-world-ad2527250f90)) | This blog post explores the benefits of handcrafting in a world dominated by technology and mass production. The author discusses how engaging in handmade crafts provides a therapeutic escape from the digital world, fosters creativity, and preserves cultural heritage. It emphasizes the mental health benefits of crafting, the value of unique, handmade items, and the importance of slowing down to appreciate traditional, hands-on processes. | **Refute:** The post argues that technology can interfere with the unique, meditative experience of crafting. It highlights how handcrafting fosters a sense of individuality, mental wellness, and cultural connection that is often lost with digital solutions or mass production. This suggests that an app for sewing might detract from the tactile, mindful aspects of the craft, which some sewists value more than convenience or digital organization. When it comes to mindful crafting, there is more than your approach and mindset. One aspect is not using technology since it makes us impatient for immediate results and provides content to be consumed rather than created.                                                                                                                                                            |

Ravelry is a community site, an organizational tool, and a yarn & pattern database for knitters and crocheters. PatternReview.com is a platform where sewists share reviews, experiences, and tips about various sewing patterns and projects.                                                                                                                                 | **Refute:** Pattern brands have already integrated project organization and material guidance into their software, making additional tools potentially redundant. They’ve also established a large community with extensive pattern reviews and discussions. However, to refute the idea that another app may be redundant, there are complaints that some of these existing apps provide information that is very vague. It’s like a recipe that says to put “a bunch of” sage or “a handful of” salt. Additionally, many sewing apps have an outdated interface. <br><br>**Support:** The discussions and reviews highlight frequent frustrations around pattern selection and project setup, showing demand for a resource that simplifies these processes. Many users mention needing help with finding suitable patterns and managing project stages. |

## VSD Analysis

### 1. STAKEHOLDERS

- **Impact: Direct Users (Beginner and Experienced Crafters) -** Users who are new to crafts may feel overwhelmed by advanced techniques, while experts might struggle with a lack of advanced features.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement a tiered onboarding system to help beginners get started with tutorials and community support. For advanced users, provide a pathway to premium features, like customization options or the ability to sell advanced patterns.
- **Impact: Indirect Users (Competing Sellers & Material Companies) -** There is a risk that sellers on other platforms could lose exclusivity due to pattern reselling or redistribution.
  - **Mitigation:** Add a verification system for patterns, allowing only approved sellers to monetize their patterns. Implement watermarks on downloadable patterns to deter unauthorized resale.
- **Impact: Conflicting Roles for Single Users -** Users who both share and purchase patterns might prioritize their own work or manipulate interactions for self-promotion.
  - **Mitigation:** Create role tags or badges that visually indicate a user’s current role (e.g., "Contributor" vs. "Learner") to distinguish between sellers, experts, and learners, helping the community remain balanced.
- **Impact: Non-Targeted Use (Inappropriate Content or Scams) -** Some users might upload irrelevant or even inappropriate content under the guise of sharing patterns.
  - **Mitigation:** Use automated content moderation combined with community flagging to detect and remove inappropriate content promptly.
- **Impact: Children -** if kids find the website they might also start doing crafts and get creative
  - Help: Providing different types of media would help even kids to learn something new

### 2. TIME

- **Impact: Reappropriation (Shifting to Social Platform) -** Users may convert the platform into a social space for sharing projects, deviating from the original educational and pattern-sharing purpose.
- **Impact: Project Management Tool Repurposing -** Some users may use the platform purely for organizing personal projects, disregarding the community sharing aspect.
  Mitigation: Incorporate subtle nudges, such as prompts to share work in progress with the community, which could promote a collaborative environment without forcing public sharing.
- **Impact: Educational Use in Classrooms -** Instructors may use the platform to teach crafting basics and conversions, which could shift its purpose from a general-use app to a more academic or structured learning tool.
  - **Mitigation:** Offer an “Educational Mode” feature that allows teachers to organize projects and highlight fundamental techniques, along with easy-to-use conversion tools. This mode could also include templates and lesson plans tailored for classroom use.
- **Impact: Environmental Consequences of Pattern Sharing -** The ease of accessing patterns may lead to increased material usage, potentially resulting in greater waste if users frequently experiment and discard materials.
  - **Mitigation:** Offer a feature for eco-friendly material recommendations and tips on optimizing material use, plus a “Green Projects” section highlighting sustainable craft projects.
- **Impact: Limiting Creativity through Standardization -** Over time, the platform may inadvertently promote a narrow set of designs and techniques, leading to a homogenization of creative outputs. This is evident in similar patterns seen on 3D-printing websites or YouTube tutorials that generate alike designs, particularly around specific themes. Users might feel confined to these common patterns, stifling innovation and personal expression.
  - **Mitigation:** Introduce features that encourage creative experimentation, such as tools that allow users to remix and adapt existing patterns. Regularly host community challenges or themed events (e.g., “Create Your Own Pattern Month”) to inspire unique contributions and highlight out-of-the-box creativity. Additionally, create a showcase section for unusual or unconventional patterns, providing visibility to diverse crafting approaches and encouraging users to explore beyond standard designs.

### 3. PERVASIVENESS

- **Impact: Geographic Cultural Differences -** Users from different regions have unique crafting styles (for example, in Turkmenistan, people not only sew but also embroider a lot and it is very distinct from western embroidery styles as seen [here](https://admin.turkmenmetbugat.gov.tm/storage/articles/62536/Q3Lj62JrHcyOCXBphFVWFxk47gt4e7A38F8wlVM7JPiWwWaseAUDdIBLXD4g.jpg) and [here](https://turkmenistan.gov.tm/storage/app/media/Images/2024/05-2024/13052024/KULTURA/13052024-0006.jpg)).
  - **Mitigation:** Provide culturally adaptive filters, allowing users to search based on regional styles (e.g., embroidery from Turkmenistan).
- **Impact: Geographic Cultural Differences -** Users from different regions have different measurement systems, which could create friction for non-U.S. users.
  - **Mitigation:** Integrate automatic measurement conversion tools to accommodate metric and imperial systems.
- **Impact: Barrier to Accessibility for Non-English Speakers -** Language limitations could restrict non-English speakers from fully engaging with the community or understanding instructions.
  - **Mitigation:** Offer multilingual support for critical instructions and community guidelines. Allow for user-submitted translations for patterns to increase accessibility organically.

### 4. VALUES

Desired Values: Ownership, community, environmental sustainability, expression

- **Impact: Ownership and Authorship of Shared Patterns -** As users share or remix patterns, the original creator's sense of ownership may be diluted, leading to conflicts over intellectual property.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement a crediting system that visibly tags the original creator of any remixed patterns. Reward users with badges or points to recognize their contributions, which could maintain the sense of ownership while fostering community.
- **Impact: Sustainability vs. Creativity -** Users often experiment with various materials, but frequent use of synthetics or non-biodegradables could harm the environment.
  - **Mitigation:** Promote eco-conscious crafting by offering guides on sustainable materials and adding a “Sustainable Choice” badge for patterns that use eco-friendly materials. Partner with eco-friendly suppliers to encourage better practices.
- **Impact: Community vs. Personal Success (Competitive Concerns) -** Experts who share their knowledge might feel less incentive if they see others profiting or building off their ideas without recognition.
  - **Mitigation:** Create a leaderboard or recognition system that rewards contributors for popular or helpful content. This could help experts feel valued and encourage ongoing support for the community.
- **Impact: Increased Demand for Non-Sustainable Materials -** With easy access to patterns, users may frequently purchase cheap synthetic materials, contributing to environmental waste.
  - **Mitigation:** Incorporate a “Sustainability Hub” featuring articles, tutorials, and sourcing options for eco-friendly materials. Add eco-filters in search options, prioritizing biodegradable and sustainable materials to educate users and promote responsible purchasing.
- **Impact: Creative Waste Through Experimentation -** Crafting often involves trial and error, leading to material wastage.
  - **Mitigation:** Offer “Eco-Friendly Tips” in pattern instructions, like suggesting material substitutions or techniques that minimize waste. Consider a reward for users who complete projects with sustainable practices, such as a "Green Crafter" badge.

## Interview Reports

### Stakeholder Interview 1

This interview reveals the complexities and motivations behind the participant’s craft journey, particularly in crocheting and knitting. Their passion for making unique, personalized items shines through, especially in gifts for loved ones. Motivated by a family tradition, their crafting journey started with a scarf inspired by their mom and grandma’s knitting, eventually growing into more ambitious projects like cardigans and amigurumi dolls. However, there’s a recurring tension between the joy of creation and the practical obstacles encountered along the way. For instance, the participant expressed frustration over estimating the right amount of yarn, describing how buying too little leads to challenges in finding matching yarn, while buying extra can be prohibitively expensive, which makes her NOT start a project altogether! An insightful quote that embodies this tension is, 'It’s really hard to start a project because even after I have an idea, I don’t know the specifics.' This need for accurate yarn estimates, paired with limited access to affordable local resources, highlights a gap that could be addressed by our website.

The interview also highlighted the participant's resourcefulness and skill in adapting patterns to suit personal projects. Having attended classes and read a foundational amigurumi book, they now excel at reading patterns, even modifying and combining free ones to create unique designs. Despite their expertise, the participant faces a “perfectionist” struggle in maintaining consistency across multiple parts of a project, which often leads to delays and big breaks along the project. [Implementing a project tracker on the website would help users maintain consistency over time. This tool could allow them to log notes on current projects, save patterns, and set reminders to check back in or resume work. They could upload photos or write notes on specific project stages, which would make it easier to pick up where they left off, even if there’s a long break, creating a space that empowers users to start and finish projects more efficiently.]

Additionally, the participant expressed a desire for easy access to beginner-friendly resources, such as specific yarn details for patterns and local store suggestions. YouTube tutorials and previous coursework were essential in learning techniques, but they still face challenges when starting a new project without clear material guidelines. By offering resources like video tutorials, yarn calculators, and community recommendations, the website could alleviate some of these pain points. The potential to connect crafters with both local and online resources could open up a world of possibilities, making it easier for them to manage budgets while achieving high-quality results.

### Expert Interview 2

The interviewee is a hands-on creator who enjoys crafting costumes and stuffed animals, preferring quick projects that allow her to see results fast. Her creative process is fluid and resourceful: she gathers inspiration from Google Images, bookmarks websites, and hunts for affordable materials, often finding budget patterns at JOANN's. They shared a flexible, improvisational approach to crafting, explaining that they "would just mesh [patterns] together to make it work" or use whatever yarn “feels/looks the best and whatever is lying around." While she's flexible with the yarn type for knitting and crochet projects, she tends to rely on pattern suggestions for fabric in sewing projects. However, she adapts based on availability, relying on touch and consultation with store staff if unsure. This approach underscores her pragmatism and highlights a balance between improvisation and method.

"Final touches get very frustrating because the patterns tend to skip those parts." Finishing details like zipper installation, adding eyes, rounding off with a ribbon are frequently glossed over. For this reason, she often resorts to additional online tutorials, pointing to a gap in user-friendly, comprehensive guides that cover all aspects of a project. Additionally, a preference for text-based patterns contrasts with their daughter's preference for video tutorials, suggesting that the ideal resource might combine both formats for accessibility. When advising others, she usually does so in person to show and help with their project. “A couple of times people asked at hobby shops on the type of yarn and how much is needed” and the interviewee would look at the pattern and help finding the right materials because “craftsy people are nice and help each other out”. This suggests an opportunity for commentary under patterns and community forums where people would provide guidance on a project.

Reflecting on her crafting experience, she envisioned a solution that would streamline the process: having complete kits with clear, beginner-friendly instructions and reliable links to specific materials. Such a resource would reduce the guesswork involved in finding the correct supplies and make the crafting experience more accessible and enjoyable, particularly for novices. This feedback suggests that a centralized website with a hybrid of instructional formats, comprehensive step-by-step guides, and shopping links could fill an existing void in DIY crafting resources. Her experiences reveal both opportunities and tensions in the DIY space, such as the need for detailed guidance without stifling creativity, making it clear that bridging this gap could offer substantial value to users like her.

### Stakeholder Interview 3

The interviewee’s knitting journey began as a response to the screen-dependent environment of remote learning during the quarantine period. She frequently saw her grandma knitting, which ultimately inspired her to learn the basics from her grandma. What began as a casual, one-time interest turned into a rewarding, meditative hobby. Knitting allows her to clear her head, with the added reward of producing handmade gifts. Her first project was a scarf with a simple garter stitch pattern. Unfamiliar with the different properties and styles of yarn, she opted for a gray yarn that was soft and machine washable. However, this choice was driven primarily by texture and color rather than an understanding of the full range of yarn types or stitch techniques. As for the quantity, she purchased an extra skein of yarn, unsure of how far one would go.

Over time as she took on more projects from knitting sweaters to blankets, she discovered more stitch techniques and their corresponding tools and patterns. Video tutorials on YouTube and VeryPink along with online communities on Ravelry and Reddit helped her learn new techniques and choose materials more effectively. However, the nuances of yarn types and techniques persisted, which reflects an opportunity to provide personalized material recommendations based on a user’s inventory, skill level, and project requirements to help knitters make choices more confidently.

One of her biggest challenges in knitting is managing the final stages of projects, like weaving in ends and blocking, which she finds tedious but necessary for a polished finish. Interruptions in workflow, such as missing supplies mid-project, also impact her motivation and progress. Her current approach involves keeping a physical notebook for notes and counts, but she still finds it difficult to maintain a clear overview of her progress, especially for more complicated projects. Her “magic wand” request underscored the desire to track her yarn stash, needles, and patterns, while also recommending patterns based on her available materials and skill level. This points to a clear gap: knitters lack a centralized tool that integrates learning, project tracking, and inventory management in one cohesive place. Additionally, she emphasized the need for flexibility, claiming that “When a pattern calls for a specific yarn or stitch, I’m never sure if my substitutes will actually work”. This highlights an opportunity that allows knitters to personalize their projects without compromising the integrity of the original design.

### Stakeholder Interview 4

The interviewee has been crocheting and sewing over several years, after a friend of hers gifted her a book with basic crocheting patterns. While sewing for her is just to patch things up like her backpack or clothes, she crochets for several hours at a time whenever she has a project she’s interested in.

Although she first started with the book, she now looks online for information on the projects she works on. Specifically, she finds a lot of inspiration on Instagram for projects, but a lot of her information is found on blogs or YouTube. She says that bloggers put a lot of information in their blogs - what materials to use, links to brands, etc. Although YouTube was “good for learning about techniques” through videos, it was usually not as specific as blogs, and was usually difficult to guess the size of all the patterns. This was interesting, as I had believed that YouTube would probably be the best place to learn things. When this happens, she needs to make several adjustments. Although this is usually fine for her now, it wasn’t as easy when she first started, especially since she would sometimes be stitching too loose or too tight. Thankfully, she also made much smaller projects in the beginning, usually with leftover yarn.

When asked to describe the process of a project, the interviewee said she first starts by looking at the general project pattern to understand it. Then, for materials, she usually had a lot of hooks, so the thing to buy was just the yarn. She, however, buys yarn for a project as it goes along, to make adjustments as it goes: “It definitely can happen where the yarn is not the right size, but I just have to make adjustments to start”. She then buys the yarn either online on Hobii, or while she’s at home she buys it at Michael’s: “It’s always nice to see the yarn in person for sizing”.

Her biggest challenge is finding time for her projects and stamina, but when asked the “magic wand” question, she said she wished someone would “instantly tell you exactly how much yarn you would need, or what adjustments you need to make, or what someone else used for the project”. This highlights a more communicative opportunity, as maybe users could post their material usages for other users.

### Stakeholder Interview 5

The interview started crocheting and knitting after graduating high school and before they started college. During that period, she had a lot of free time and had some previous interest in learning how to do crochets after watching several videos on Youtube. Thus, after one of her friends gave her a small crochet kit with some yarn and hook, she started her journey into crocheting.

Usually, the interviewee spent around 1-2 hours a week doing crochets working on mostly small objects like keychains and cup holders. However, she did knit bigger projects like a red blouse and gloves. Her first project was a glove with the fingers exposed that looked like a cat’s paw. Additionally, she crochet gifts for her friends and family.

She learned to crochet by watching only Youtube video tutorials and seeing how the other person did the crocheting step by step. Although she tried following some blogs on crocheting projects, it was hard for her to follow as she would get lost trying to follow the images/text instructions. Hence, she greatly prefers videos as she can tell where to knit and copy the stitches done by the person in the video.

Furthermore, when she started crocheting, she went to a craft store to buy supplies. Initially, she bought yarn of different colors that she thought she would use often and a medium size hook. But then, she noticed that the yarn she bought was too thin for the results she wanted and so she sought ways to make the yarn thicker. Eventually, she bought thicker yarn and a hook dedicated to this type of yarn.

Now, for her to do a project, she checks if she has the necessary supplies. Then she watches the video tutorial on the object, and if she has enough time and motivation to do the crochet, she starts the project. This is the biggest challenge she has while trying to crochet.

Finally, if she had a “magic wand” to help her on her crochets, she would make it so her wrists don’t hurt as much. The reason why is that crochet can be hard on the wrists, so much that you could develop carpal tunnel. Thus, wrist stretches are crucial for her to not have her wrists be in pain.

The most common gripe that all interviewees had was resource management. It was difficult to know how much yarn they would need, and exactly what kind of yarn would work best for them, which would often stop them from starting or continuing their projects. Several interviewees discussed how information from others about the materials they used would be or have been helpful, so a key opportunity could be allowing for the app to be very community-driven, where users can easily help out other users and provide the materials they used along with alternatives and links to tutorials. To make sure that our users would not have any more issues with resource management, providing an interface that allows indicating very clear and specific material usage is also key.

Also, although the crafters’ adaptiveness was extremely impressive, it revealed a gap: there was a huge lack of comprehensive guides, which especially hurt beginners. Many constantly had to find several different tutorials for their one project, which suggests that all-encompassing project guides could be of great use. Furthermore, interviewees stated that both video and text based tutorials were helpful, showing us that our website should have both to fit any preference.

Finally, tracking and consistency was another common issue, especially for larger projects. Several interviewees suggested a project tracker or inventory manager to track yarn and other materials, record progress with an easy-to-organize note taker, and provide personalized recommendations based on available materials.

## Revised Impact Case

The problem of resource management and information seeking for sewing, crocheting and knitting is important because many beginners and hobbyists struggle to find the correct materials or techniques leading to unfinished projects. In addition, there is a lack of comprehensive guides for basics or techniques, creating a knowledge gap between experts and non-experts, and having beginners lost looking at several tutorials for the same project.

Thus, our solution to address this problem is a comprehensive sewing/knitting/crocheting app with a focus on community sharing of projects and knowledge, specially between hobbyists and experts. In addition, the app would include project management tools to keep track of materials and projects, and several text and video tutorials of basics or more complicated techniques for hobbyists. All of this integrated into a concise, easy to understand platform.

We believe that our app is a good solution because users would be able to easily find the correct materials and tutorials for their projects. In addition, it would make it easier to track current resources and the progress of different projects. Furthermore, the knowledge gap between experts and hobbyists/beginners would be bridge closer. Thus, in all, users would be able to finish projects much faster and start up more complex and innovative projects.

We could measure user retention, project completion rates, community engagement, and other engagement metrics (e.g., resource management, use of tutorials/guides, project tracking) to prove that this app is a good solution to making sewing more accessible and organized. Additionally, user satisfaction surveys and reductions in project setup time would provide further insights into the app's impact on the sewing experience.
